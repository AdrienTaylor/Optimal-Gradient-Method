# Optimal-Gradient-Method

This code can be used to reproduce the results from the work

> [1] Yoel Drori, Adrien B Taylor, "An optimal gradient method for smooth (possibly strongly) convex minimization", 2021.

## Authors

- **Yoel Drori**
- [**Adrien Taylor**](http://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/)

## Getting started

To use the code, download the repository and add it to the path in Matlab.

**Notes:** 
- One file requires Mathematica (for verifying analytical developments).
- Parts of this code requires [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) along with a suitable SDP solver (e.g., Sedumi, SDPT3, Mosek).
- One file additionally requires the installation of the Performance Estimation Toolbox ([PESTO](https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox)).
