## Notes

- One file requires Mathematica (for verifying analytical developments).
- Parts of this code requires [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) along with a suitable SDP solver (e.g., Sedumi, SDPT3, Mosek).
- One file additionally requires the installation of the Performance Estimation Toolbox ([PESTO](https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox)).
